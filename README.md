# Stereolabs ZED - UE5 Examples

This repository contains Unreal examples projects that demonstrate how to create advanced Interactive Applications using the ZED SDK and Unreal Engine 5.

**UE5_Examples** is a single project with a variety of small samples, each meant to highlight a single feature of the ZED UE5 plugin. 

## Getting started

This version of the plugin is compatible with Unreal Engine **5.1**, and requires the [**ZED SDK 4.0**](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/get-started-with-zed/#download-and-install-the-zed-sdk) and a **Windows setup**, because for now we are only compatible with the DirectX API.

- To see our implementation of Live Link with the ZED, go here : [ZED Live Link Plugin](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-LiveLink-plugin)

### Installation

- Download this repository..
- Right click on the *ZEDSamples.uproject*, select *switch Unreal Engine version* and choose our ue5 you previously installed in the list.
- Build the solution by pressing **Ctrl + F5**. Once the build is done, it will start the project in the UE5 Editor. 

You can now start the project with a double click on *ZEDSamples.uproject*.
